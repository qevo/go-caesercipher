Caeser Cipher History

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher,
Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption
techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext
is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example,
with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The
method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
